Form 1.

Two pill bars and a content pane.

Form 2.

Variants with elbows connecting a frame around a content pane.
The two basic variations are determined by the relative sizing of the bars:
a thick column/thin row, or a thin column/thick row.
There is however also a variation with no elbow rounding, and another where
sizing on both bars is of the same weight.

If we leave out two borders, we can focus developing layouts and styling
composites of just the elbow and one bar. To create a basic form we require
four instances of that component with different orientation/direction
parameters. This basic composite also provides for a convenient base for more
complex forms.

Form 3.

A variant on the basic form 2 element with an offset, allowing to align two
basic form-2 composites so that they share one row/column.

Not sure yet if this has two or four content panes.
