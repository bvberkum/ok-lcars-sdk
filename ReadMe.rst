OK! LCARS SDK |badges|
======================
:version: 0.0.2

An investigation and demonstration creating `okudagrams` for WebView (Android)
and anything that can do modern HTML/CSS rendering.

This is based on the original work from `LCARS-SDK`__, which has some big
advantages over other methods of LCARS generation.

- No need for Flash, Java or other embedded software.
- No need to prepare vector images. Ie. export static illustrations and load in
  Flash, SVG, etc.

- Still has/can do a fully scalable interface, potentially could do
  Bootstrap-style repsonsive classes.

- re-uses all of the HTML DOM and CSS specs; scripting, security, development
  tools.

- runs on every? modern consumer OS. And by using modern web-technologies can
  be built into any kind of client/server, multi-screen, multi-user app as
  required.
