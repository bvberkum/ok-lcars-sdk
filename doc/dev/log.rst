(Version 0.0.3)

The LCARS SDK project has a lot of elements already. I'd like to build a few layouts, but I wasn't sure about the JS API. And I did not want to write HTML directly. Also I was not entirely happy with the CSS setup. So I started with Pug and Sass to explore the setup.

At v0.0.3 that was mostly written to be a server-side, JSON driven setup. Meanwhile SDK v4 was released with some restructuring and more JS API, which deserves a look later.

I wrote some inline bar CSS and preliminary inline-box, and am experimenting with sizing schemes. With SASS it is easy to generate different class-selector setups. I would really want to integrate with the SDK css, but there's a few things about the current setup I don't like. And I need to update to v4 first anyway.

Then get inlinebar into
ok-sdk-form-1-0-1
form-1-2-1
