@TODO:1 See how far HTML/CSS concept can be applied to okudagrams, before much of anything else. See [Form 2.1 (4)]


Web pages will never be adequate platforms to render OK, but it is possible to prepare styles for a distinct but simple set of diagram elements that together can reproduce some common forms seen on the show.

With that caveat, there are four forms that are important. And it would be nice to have templates for each of these, to play around with as a web-client.

1. The 'pillbar' viewscreen; two bars with detached caps. One top one bottom of the content pane.
2. A (partially) framed viewscreen. A column or columns in addition to the pillbars, and use of "elbows" to draw a frame around the content pane. Most often seen as a 'C' frame.
3. 30%-split, the most iconic form with LH column bending into bar at just under 1/3th from the top.
4. Z and/or S frames.
