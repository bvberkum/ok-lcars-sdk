`OK!` is an experimental, personal "table" rendering project. The name is an
homage to Mike Okuda, the graphics designer responsible for the iconic Star Trek
LCARS interface designs. The main `ok` project is not public, due to IP concerns.

Tables, speadsheets, diagrams are a powerful way to organize datums |---| pieces
of data that suggest relations by horizontal and vertical ranking. This model
is a classic one that goes back decades into computing history. It was Ted
Nelson who already in 1965 conceptualized an abstraction of this model where
each unique datum could lay not just in two dimensions (one row, one column)
but in an infinite space with endless dimensions. But where each datum ('cell')
can still appear only once in each dimension.

Not much has happened in general since. Modern technologies reinvent how to do
some things, but to build e.g. a spreadsheet app still a lot of well-thought out
work is needed.

LCARS-style Okudagrams established a decorative design that incorporates tables
too, but on a whole new level.

Its seductive on many levels:

- it is symmetrical and full of typical patterns, making it beautiful and hinting
  at some extensive modularity even if expressed as a untelligable sea of
  colors, numbers and abbreviations. |---| Starfleet officiers must be very
  intelligent indeed.
- its colorful, and bold! Even the font face is a statement on form; uniformity
  over detail.
- it is simple, only rectangulars and rounded rectangular element parts. But it
  curves, wraps and adapts to whatever control surface extent. The black
  surfaces enhance the illusion of ubiquitious computing, it all
  becomes a giant interface to an immense organisation.
- its ranks of square angles, and added curves suggest beginnings and ends,
  groups, ordering, enclosure, separation, frame (or chrome) vs. content,
  context vs. text, and adds even more suggestions of visual "language" compared
  to the classic table/spreadsheet model.

It in short suggests complex, integrated data and structure, interaction and even
animation but with a very simple design element set. No doubt though many
different "languages" or "grammars" may be conjured up based on these elements.
