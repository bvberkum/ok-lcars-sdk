(A) 2018-08-06 1: Look at more complex elbow layouts, but after TODO-2 I guess. Also build a thick horizontal, thin vertical variant like used on many control surfaces (form 4 / layout 2.1)
(B) 2018-09-29 7: Wrap documentation/app at Sitefile into LCARS style as well. Some tweaks needed to Sitefile hnav client-component.
(B) 2018-09-29 8: Documentation for CSS classes and usage; layout principles, SASS, adaptive pages, etc. @docs
(B) 2019-04-23 12: Merge YAML-OK metadata (style/nav etc) with layout templates <app/sdk-demo/layout/form-1.yaml> more dynamic re-usable pages, not sure about client/server-side and probably get Sitefile testing going again first
(C) 2018-09-29 9: Styling should be more confined to specific elements, not change page's html/body/div... @bugs ie. check archive.is, web.archive.org. Solve with [TODO-2].
(C) 2018-08-06 2: Rewrite to SASS, add adaptive classes. [TODO-8] First get some documentation system going
(E) 2018-08-06 3: Make compatible with bootstrap, and for use with docutils documents
(D) 2018-08-06 4: Build reusable components, based on SASS/script, maybe see about webelements at some point
(F) 2018-08-06 5: Add scripting to synchronize multiple windows over websocket, and for live updates from pub/sub server routes
(F) 2018-09-29 6: Cannot run repo with sitefile directly <run.sh> setup submodules for non-dev @bugs @DevOps <.gitmodules>
x (F) 2018-12-11 10: Travis build is empty, add npm/travis scripts as needed. Maybe start with some linters for Pug/SASS.
