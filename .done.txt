x (A) 2018-12-11 2019-04-24 11: Fix simple top/bottom pillbar (form 1) for pad/mobile. Removed scripts, problem was in some javascript which is not used, not needed for original LCARS SDK layouts. Disabled scripts for now.
x (F) 2018-12-11 2020-11-26 10: Travis build is empty, add npm/travis scripts as needed. Maybe start with some linters for Pug/Sass. Resolved: using Gruntfile ``grunt test`` with Sass and Pug lint detector for CI flow. @DevOps
